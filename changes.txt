v. 1.4.8, Jan 9, 2019
- updated build.gradle

v. 1.4.7, Nov 19, 2018
- update url for 'import references tool'

v. 1.4.6, Oct 15, 2018
- refactored build.gradle to produce lean runnable jar

v. 1.4.5, Sep 14, 2018
- moved from subversion to github
  implemented automatic conversion of data source field: 'UniProtKB' -> 'UniProt'

v. 1.4.4, Aug 22, 2018
- optimized handling of dates for IEA annotations, to minimize updates of created_date for annotations

v. 1.4.3, Jan 23, 2018
- implemented 5% delete threshold for stale annotations; configurable in properties file

v. 1.4.2, Jan 22, 2018
- implemented automatic conversion of data source field, currently: 'UniProt' -> 'UniProtKB'

v. 1.4.1, Jul 18, 2017
- IEA GO annotation for pipelines have their created date set to current date less 3 month, to avoid
  problems with GOC QC (IEA GO annotations older than 1 year are filtered out)

v. 1.4.0, Nov 8, 2016
- migrated build system from ANT to GRADLE

v. 1.3.1, Jun 21, 2016 -- per RGDD-1227
- when loading annotations with present 'annotation extension field'
  (http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension)
  relations are validated against 'http://viewvc.geneontology.org/viewvc/GO-SVN/trunk/ontology/extensions/gorel.obo'
  and obsolete relations are deleted from the 'annotation extension field'.
  Reason: if we submit such annotations to GOC, they will be rejected.

v. 1.3.0, Jun 15, 2016
- updated FTP data sources: EBI changed the files on their FTP site

v. 1.2.11, May 13, 2016
- inserted annotations use current machine timestamp as the CREATED_DATE -- per RGDD-1194
- in-RGD annotations written to gaf files take CREATED-DATE from database, to be consistent
- discontinued refresh of annotations to olfactory genes (they will be harmful due to ticket RGDD-1194)

v. 1.2.10, Oct 21, 2015
- updated jars; code tune up for handling qualifiers -- per RGDD-1115
  optimized code by updating FULL_ANNOT table in batches (instead of per row basis)

v. 1.2.9, Feb 16, 2015
- updated jars; improved logging

v. 1.2.8, Dec 16, 2014
- updated jars; added improved QC for annotation qualifiers -- per RGDD-1027

v. 1.2.7, Aug 5, 2014
- annotations with inactive ref_rgd_ids are no longer created - per RGDD-959
 (some PubMed ids associate with multiple references, one of which was active;
  given pubmed id, old code picked up associated reference at random, instead of picking up the active one)
- log deleted stale annotations into file 'GoaDeleted.log'

v. 1.2.6, Jul 11, 2014
- skip from processing IPI annotations to catalytic activity terms - per RGDD-946

v. 1.2.5, Jun 23, 2014
- skipping from processing uninformative annotations to some top-level terms (terms having 'Not4Curation' synonym)

v. 1.2.4, Jun 18, 2014
- skipping from processing uninformative annotations to some top-level terms - per RGDD-934

v. 1.2.3, May 20, 2014
- code refactoring (reduced amount of code, moved some of sql code to rgdcore)

v. 1.2.2, May 8, 2014 - per RGDD-919
- automatic import of references pointed to by processed PubMed ids
- sped up processing by caching of some data

v. 1.2.1, May 7, 2014 - per RGDD-878
- fixed handling of qualifiers (especially visible for evidence code 'IKR')

v. 1.2.0, Apr 21, 2014 - per RGDD-913
- created_date is updated if needed
- minor code refactoring to simplify code
- simplified GOAnnotation.pl script

v. 1.1.0, Dec 18, 2013 - per RGDD-859
- perform custom query to refresh annotations for Olr gene
- refactored code to replace custom sql code with methods from rgdcore
- changed logic from drop-nad-reload into incremental update to speed up pipeline and improve annotations stability
- packaged java code into a standalone jar

v. 1.0.3, Dec 28, 2012
  updated rgdcore.jar: unique index on FULL_ANNOT table no longer has fields TERm and EXP_RGD_ID    - per RGDD-555
